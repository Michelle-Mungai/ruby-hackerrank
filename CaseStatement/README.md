<!-- BDD -->
1. Use a case statement to loop through
2. When the condition is met the loop should output for that condition.
3. If none of the conditions are met then an else statement gets output instead.

<!-- PSEUDOCODE -->
START
1. Define a method with a parameter
2. Use the parameter in the case loop statement
3. Declare the conditions and the outputs for each condition
4. Declare an else output if none of the conditions are met
